# VCallZer

* The project was initiated during Winter of Code 1.0 by [DSC IIIT Kalyani](https://github.com/DSC-IIIT-Kalyani) and is currently under development.
* The idea behind this is to facilitate a video calling service built with python sockets(IPv4) and Open-CV, which replaces the users voice by a robotic/AI voice and the video by a neon projection of the users face on a black screen for anonimity purposes. 

A screenshot of the connected system is shown below:
